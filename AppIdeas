App Ideas

SUB HUB

Sub Hub would be an app for schools and/or teachers to schedule substitute teachers.

The inspiration for the app comes from school experience.
Observation showed one staff member scheduled all needed substitute teachers.  Excessive time was eaten away looking up numbers,  recording in a calendar, confirming, and re-scheduling.
Some schools have teachers secure their own substitutes, still requiring large amounts of time as teachers message the office personnel to gather sub contact info and availability.
Occasionally, there would be  no shows when a sub forgot she was scheduled to come in.

The goal of Sub Hub is  to streamline the scheduling process, saving valuable time for all parties concerned.  Sub Hub would have a list of school  approved subs with contact information.  Sub dates would be scheduled on a calendar showing when a particular teacher is available to sub, when she is already scheduled or has  blacked out dates unavailable for any other  reason.  It would be similar to vacation rental sites.




CLEAN IT

Clean It would be a quick reference for cleaning tips.  
Targeted to millennials who may not have learned from mamma, Clean It would contain info on how to clean spills and stains at home or in the car.
Exhaustive lists can be found online, but Clean It  would be more concise, focusing on spills such as wine or fruit juice on a sofa, milk in a car seat, spaghetti sauce on a shirt, etc.
